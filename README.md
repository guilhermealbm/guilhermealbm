### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme Miranda and I'm a software engineer. I wrote my very first android app for a high school project back in 2015 and fell in love since then. 
- My main skills are on Android, Kotlin and Java development.
- CompSci undergrad student at [DCC / UFMG](https://dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/)
- Student of [Applied Software Engineering Research Group (ASERG)](http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/)
