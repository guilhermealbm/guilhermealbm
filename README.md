### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working at Accedo.tv, I'm an Android Engineer with a BSc degree in Computer Science at UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais). Proficient in Kotlin, Java, Python, and C++, I developed my first [app](https://github.com/guilhermealbm/HortinhaB) as a school project back in 2015 and continue to love working with Android ever since. I'm passionate about using mobile technology to solve real-world problems and I have a strong foundation in both MVVM and MVC architecture and hands-on experience with Hilt, Compose, Room, Koin, and other tools.

Curiously, I like football (or soccer? haha) a lot. Ironically given my tech profession, I also enjoy taking [analog photos](https://www.lomography.com/homes/guilhermealbm). And finally, I'm really into adverbs.
