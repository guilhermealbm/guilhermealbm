### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android Engineer who created his first [app](https://github.com/guilhermealbm/HortinhaB) for a school project in 2015 and has been in love with it ever since. Currently, I work at [Inter Bank](https://www.bancointer.com.br/) and study Computer Science at [DCC / UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais)](https://dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/). I have experience with Kotlin, Java, Python and C++. On Android, I have experience with Hilt, Compose, Room, Koin, etc. aside from mvvm and mvc architectures.
